		<p>The double-walled <a href="https://amzn.to/2M7Fv0M">Hilleberg Nallo 2 tent</a> is bomber. I've used it in rain, snow and strong winds in the Cascades. Unfortunately, a couple of tiny holes recently appeared in both the inner and outer walls of my Nallo.</p>
		<p>I contacted Hilleberg for advice, and they emailed me back a few hours later.</p>
		<p>"If they are only a few millimeters, you can almost move the fibers around to make it even smaller and then just add seam sealer over it. For the outer tent you need a SilNet and for the inner tent the SeamGrip. If the holes are larger than just the millimeter size described above you need to sew a patch on them. There really is nothing that glues very well to the fabrics. You would sew a patch and then add the seam sealer to the back of the stitches." – Hilleberg Rep</p>
		<p>The solution worked great. I first hand-washed the tent in my bathtub (no soaps), thoroughly dried it, then applied the sealants. A day later, they were ready for my next trip.</p>
